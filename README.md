# Problem-Solver
                               * Introduction *
                                
• Mathematical problem solver helps to solve the matrix, statistics and some basic 
arithmetic operations. 
• It provides solution after performing certain operation in system. 
• This system helps students to know correct answer of their questions and help them 
identify their mistakes. 
• It is user-friendly as it guide the user for certain input which required therefore it helps 
to get correct digits and operator and it can be use to solve simple mathematical 
equations.
 
                                * Objective *
                                 
• As nowadays many children or students uses mobiles, laptops, computers for 
entertainment except that these devices can be used to for learning purpose as well. 
• I have chosen the project mathematical equation solver so that students would get 
facility to check the answer of their equations without depending on others. 
• If they can check that the solution is correct or not they can move to solve other 
equations with confident. If the students are not sure about the correct solution then 
they might get demotivated and leave the work.

                               * Conclusion *
                               
The overall conclusion of the project is simply helped students to 
identify their mistakes.
